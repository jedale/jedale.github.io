For a decade I was a Software Test Engineer and Software Development Engineer in Test at Microsoft, where I worked on products ranging from Windows to Xbox to Zune. Following my time at MS I went to college, where I earned degrees in math and economics from Rutgers University. I then went on to pursue a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Washington. After a couple of years of seeing the academic sausage get made, I decided to return to the private sector and pursue a career in data science.

This blog is a place for me to write about my data science projects, most of which focus on analyzing NFL football.
