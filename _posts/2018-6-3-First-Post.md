Hi I'm Jeff! This blog is a place where I can write about a few of my interests: statistics, data science, and NFL football. I'm writing this blog with a few goals in mind: first I'd like to have a platform on which to share some analysis I've done, preferably in a way that pushes me to build said analyses into finished products. I find that it's easy for me to dig into some data, answer a question to my satisfaction (perhaps with some cursory modeling and visualizations), but never actually get to the point where I have a presentable product. 

Second, I'd like to be able to share some of the things I've learned, both in terms of the code I've written as well as the insights I've gained. Lately I am interested in two broad topics: measuring how NFL rosters are constructed, and in understanding the Seattle Seahawks (my favorite team). I don't think anything I'm doing is revolutionary, but I do think it's interesting and worth checking out.

Finally, I'm hoping to learn as well. Both by having this blog as a motivation to continue with my work, and by perhaps getting a (small) audience to comment on and provide suggestions. 

## About Me

I'm a former engineer with over a decade of experience on the test side of the business. I worked as both an STE and a SDET at Microsoft, where I worked on products ranging from Windows to Xbox to the Zune MP3 player. Following my time at Microsoft (which began when I was 19) I decided to pursue academic economics, which pursuit began with earning degrees in mathematics and economics from Rutgers University. I then enrolled in the economics Ph.D. program at the University of Washington, where I focused my studies on econometrics and empirical industrial organization. After a couple of years it became obvious that academia really wasn't for me (seeing the sausage get made wasn't exactly appetizing), so I'm now returning to the private sector, seeking work in the area of data science and analytics.
